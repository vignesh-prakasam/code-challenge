# README

This is the Jokepit code challenge project. When you enter a dog breed, a picture of the dog is shown. This project uses Rails 7 with Tailwind.css. Hotwire has been used to achieve the display of the picture without a page load. Additionally, an autocomplete plugin has been used to fill in the dog breed name. 

The code is hosted at [https://code-challenge-1.onrender.com](https://code-challenge-1.onrender.com).

## Steps to run in localhost:

1. Run `bundle install` to install the necessary Ruby gems.
2. Run `yarn install` to install the necessary JavaScript packages.
3. Run `./bin/dev` to start the development server.
